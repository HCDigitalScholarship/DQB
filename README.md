This is a repo for the ongoing project to digitze the Dictionary of Quaker Biography records held at Haverford College. 

Steps include:

1) Scanning of records. 
2) OCR of document scans. 
3) Creation of TEI files for each individual record.
4) A Django application to store digital objects and facilitate search and discovery.
